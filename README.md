Introduction
Build a production-ready Subscription Management System API that handles real users, real money, and real business logic.

Authenticate users using JWTs, connect a database, create models and schemas, and integrate it with ORMs. Structure the architecture of your API to ensure scalability and seamless communication with the frontend.

Lessons Learned
Creating this project was a valuable learning experience. Here are some key takeaways:

Scalable Architecture: Designing an API with a scalable architecture is crucial for handling growth and ensuring maintainability. Proper structuring of routes, controllers, and services makes the codebase easier to manage and extend.

Security Best Practices: Implementing JWT authentication and advanced rate limiting with Arcjet taught me the importance of securing an application against common threats. Ensuring that user data and transactions are protected is paramount.

Database Modeling: Working with MongoDB and Mongoose provided insights into effective database modeling and relationships. Understanding how to structure data and optimize queries is essential for performance.

Error Handling: Implementing global error handling and input validation improved the robustness of the API. Proper error handling ensures that the application can gracefully handle unexpected situations and provide meaningful feedback to users.

Automated Workflows: Integrating Upstash for automated email reminders demonstrated the power of automation in enhancing user experience. Automating routine tasks can save time and reduce the risk of human error.

Logging and Monitoring: Setting up logging mechanisms for better debugging and monitoring helped in maintaining the application. Effective logging is crucial for identifying and resolving issues quickly.

By building this project, I gained a deeper understanding of full-stack development and the various components that contribute to a production-ready application.
